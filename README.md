## Reflection
This is a test done in 1 day. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding ant design and redux.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Pagination. This lead me to spend a few hour on a research
